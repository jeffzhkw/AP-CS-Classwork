**Introduction**

##Class
In the Java(TM) programming language, a type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition defines instance and class variables and methods, as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of the class. If the superclass is not explicitly specified, the superclass will implicitly be Object.

##Object
The principal building blocks of object-oriented programs. Each object is a programming unit consisting of data (instance variables) and functionality (instance methods). See also class.

##Attribute
It's typically a public constant or a public variable that can be accessed directly.

##Behavior
Behavior is an abstract class that defines two methods that must be overridden by a subclass: An initialization method, called once when the behavior becomes "live," and a processStimulus method called whenever appropriate by the Java 3D behavior scheduler

##Encapsulation
The localization of knowledge within a module. Because objects encapsulate data and implementation, the user of an object can view the object as a black box that provides services. Instance variables and methods can be added, deleted, or changed, but as long as the services provided by the object remain the same, code that uses the object can continue to use it without being rewritten. See also instance variable, instance method.

##Constructor 
A pseudo-method that creates an object. In the Java(TM) programming language, constructors are instance methods with the same name as their class. Constructors are invoked using the new keyword.

##Invoke
To call a method

##Getter methods 
Retrieve a value of a variable 

##Setter methods
Update value of a variable. 

A class specifies the data and methods that constitute each object.  For each of the following classes, describe what the attributes or data might be and also what methods or behaviors you think are appropriate. 
a) A fax machine class. Objects of this class enable you to send or receive faxes.
b) An audio speaker class
c) A computer mouse class
d) A TV remote control class.

Define these terms 

1. Inheritance
2. Superclass
3. Subclass
4. extends
5. super()
6. What is the difference between superclass and subclass, give at least 1 example?
7. Which is bigger? A superclass or a subclass?

1. It takes methods from one class and gives to another class that it can be used
2. A more general class.
3. A more specific class under a superclass
4. Extends is a way in java code to indicate that the class before "extends" is under superclass that appear after "extends"
5. Super() is a method that takes the constructor of superclass.
6. subclass is one category under a superclass. For example, class students is under class person. 
7. Sub class is bigger
